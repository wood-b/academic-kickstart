With the rise of modern high performance computers, it is possible to run quantum and classical simulations in automated high-throughput fashion. I have contributed to a number of open source repositories that enable high-throughput chemistry and materials science. The software stack includes: [pymatgen](https://github.com/materialsproject/pymatgen), [custodian](https://github.com/materialsproject/custodian), and [atomate](https://github.com/hackingmaterials/atomate). Check out our [atomate](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.commatsci.2017.07.030) publication.
