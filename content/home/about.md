# Bio

I am an [AS&T](http://ast.berkeley.edu) (applied physics) graduate student at UC Berkeley finishing my PhD in the spring of 2019. As a PhD student in [Kristin Perssonâ€™s Group](https://perssongroup.lbl.gov) (founders of the [Materials Project](https://materialsproject.org)), my research focused on the physics of conducting polymers with the end goal of enhanced materials design. Primarily, I used a combination of quantum chemistry and statistical mechanics to model and describe disordered polymers. Looking forward, I am interested in leveraging advances in statistics, mathematics, and computer science to develop models and algorithms for a variety of physical systems.
