# Bio

I am a computational chemist at UC Berkeley finishing my PhD in the spring of 2019. As a PhD student in Kristin Persson's group (founders of the [Materials Project](https://materialsproject.org)), my research focused on fundamental knowledge---and ultimately enhanced design---of conductive polymers. Looking forward, I am interested in accelerating the discovery and design of molecules and materials by leveraging recent developments in machine learning.
